Description

Kubernetes is a wonderful technology with massive adoption but the road to production may have some bumps. 

In this session we'll look at how we partnered with the community to make it easier. Simplifying DevOps, setting up collaborative development environments, scaling production in unpredictable scenarios and even how to bring DevOps to Machine Learning, bridging the gaps between software developers, data scientists and data engineers. And by the way, what is the role of Kubernetes in databases? 

Join this session to know real-world stories and best practices. Demos and code heavy.
